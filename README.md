# Spofity React #

## Description ## 

A replica of Spotify's user interface, using React to create a front end website hosted on Github Pages.


Adapted from the repository by https://github.com/Pau1fitzm, 

* Replaced classes with hooks
* Used Redux's MapState and MapDispatchToProps
* Tested elements with Jest  

Users can log in with their username and password to see playlists, recently played, saved songs, saved albums, making use of the Spotify's extensive APIs. Users will be automatically logged out on closing the window.
